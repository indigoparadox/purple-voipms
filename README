This is kind of a rough attempt at a simple SMS send/receive protocol plugin
for Pidgin. It requires a phone number with SMS service through VOIP.ms. You
can find more information at: http://wiki.voip.ms/article/SMS

= Notes =

* Make sure to specify the DID you'd like to send messages from/receive
  messages for on the "Advanced" tab when you create an account.

* When you add a buddy, use their 10-digit phone number with no spaces/dashed
  as their screen name. You will also need to show offline buddies to see the
  buddy you've added, but you can then right-click on their screen name and
  choose "Show When Offline" to show them even when hiding other offline
  buddies.
