This is a COMPLETELY UNOFFICIAL rough attempt at a simple SMS send/receive
protocol plugin for Pidgin. It requires a phone number with SMS service through
VOIP.ms. You can find more information at: http://wiki.voip.ms/article/SMS

= Notes =

* Make sure to specify the DID you'd like to send messages from/receive
  messages for on the "Advanced" tab when you create an account.

* When you add a buddy, use their 10-digit phone number with no spaces/dashed
  as their screen name.
